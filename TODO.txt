SineWaveVoice:

SynthAudioSource:

** Move AWaveTable into SineWavetable:
  ** Move all implementation
  ** Add Const to SineWaveable::getNextSample();
    - Make sure it doesn't break const-ness


On initial start of program, make sure the tuning is set to standard
  -Make a standard tuning Tuning class?
 
Initialize SineWavetable._sound to nullptr and add check so that on start up _sound dynamic_cast doesn't fail

Relook at the Singleton to see if it can be done better

Change member variables to have _ in front

Clean up #include <> files

** Remove holer in Tuning

Check we can remove Tuning ptr from SineWavetable
  - We get from the singelton now

Redesign wavetableSound so that it doesn't maintain it's own delta. Put it in the wavetableState class

Reincorporate _level in SineWaveVoice so it doesn't clip
  -Why is it clipping? Doesn't the synth mix them?A

Look into why big Scala Files doesn't work right
