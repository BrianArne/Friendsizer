# Friendsizer - A Standalone Synthesizer for Alternate Tunings

## Basic Overview
Friendsizer is a sinewave wavetable synthesizer for exploring alternate tunings. Friendsizer reads Scala (.scl) files provided by the user to create the alternate tunings. Download common Scala files or even create your own!

## How To Use
A user can select a [Scala File](http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/scl_format.html) from the file browser on the left-handside of the synthesizer. A double click will load the file and the relevant information provided about the tuning by the Scala file will be displayed above the keyboard. At anypoint, a user can click the button above the file browser to return the keyboard to standard tuning.

## What Friendsizer Is Not
Friendsizer is not a synthesizer for music production. Friendsizer is a simple tool to intially explore alternate tunings for people that may not have access to DAWs with a slew of plugins. Think of it as a tool for students.

## How To Install
Honestly, I hadn't really thought about how people would use it besides myself. The easiest way would most likely be by cloning the repo, and using the [JUCE Projucer](https://juce.com/discover/projucer) project file to build for your IDE and compiling the code from there. You will need [JUCE](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) on your computer to build the project. If you are interested in this tool, please reach out and I can help you build your project.

Thanks friends!
