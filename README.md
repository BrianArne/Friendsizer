# Friendsizer - A Standalone Synthesizer for Alternate Tunings

## Basic Overview
Friendsizer is a sinewave wavetable synthesizer for exploring alternate tunings. Friendsizer reads Scala (.scl) files provided by the user to create the alternate tunings. Download common Scala files or even create your own!

## How To Use
A user can select a [Scala File](http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/scl_format.html) from the file browser on the left-handside of the synthesizer. A double click will load the file and the relevant information provided about the tuning by the Scala file will be displayed above the keyboard. At any point, a user can click the button above the file browser to return the keyboard to standard tuning. Sound can be played by selecting a MIDI device plugged into the computer from the combobox at the top of the application or by using the mouse to click the keyboard supplied at the bottom of the application. If the musical keyboard on the application has been clicked by the mouse, you can use your computer keyboard to play the notes as well.

## What Friendsizer Is Not
Friendsizer is not a synthesizer for music production. Friendsizer is a simple tool to explore alternate tunings for people that may not have access to DAWs and a slew of plugins. Think of it as a tool for students.

## How To Install
Honestly, I hadn't really thought about how people would use the tool besides myself. The easiest way would most likely be by cloning the repo, and using the [JUCE Projucer](https://juce.com/discover/projucer) project file to build for your IDE and compiling the code from there. You will need [JUCE](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) on your computer to build the project. If you are interested in this tool, please reach out and I can help you build your project.

Thanks friends!
